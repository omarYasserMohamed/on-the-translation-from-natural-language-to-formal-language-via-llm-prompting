Given a text and a question. The task is to use the defined rules of the allowed operators, of constants and variables naming of predicate naming, and of predicate naming to parse every sentence in the text and the question into first-order logic formulas and list all the used predicates and constants as the given examples. Never add the Query to the set of Facts. Translate every information in each sentence.
The allowed operators are the following:
    1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
    2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
    3) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
    4) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
    5) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
    6) logical universal quantification: ∀x
    7) logical existential quantification: ∃x
Output format for each fact : logic form ::: description

The rules of the predicates naming are as following:
    1) The predicate names has to be extracted from the verbal phrase of each sentence starting with the main verb followed by the adverb in the form mainVerb_adverb. 
    2) If some verbs have no corresponding adverbs then only give the verb name in the list.
    3) Never use negations like "not" in any combination.
    4) If there is an expression without a verb use the full adjective phrase to form a combination in the form is_adjective_phrase.
    5) If the verb is "am", "is", "are", "was", "were" then the full adjective phrase of the sentence has to be taken instead of the adverb and take "is" instead of the main verb in the form is_adjective_phrase.
    6) Never use the predicates as infix operator such (e.g. x predicate y).
    7) Never use embedded predicates ( e.g. predicate_one(predicate_two(x)) or predicate_one(predicate_two(x), predicate_three(x)) ).
    8) Never use the same predicate with differnt number of arguments (e.g. plays(x) and plays(x, y)).
    

The rules of constants and variables naming are as following:
    1) All variables have to be a character of the following set of characters {u,v,w,x,y,z}.
    2) The priority order of using the variables is the following order x, y, z, u, v, w.
    3) Never use the same semantic for both the constants and predicates in the first-order logic formulas

            
Examples to be used as a guidance for the expected input and output would be as following:
